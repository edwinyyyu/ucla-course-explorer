M202. Advanced Topics in Cryogenic Electron Microscopy
Units: 3.0
(Same as Biological Chemistry M202.) Lecture, two hours; discussion, one hour. Students master advanced topics in membrane protein biology, and learn both theory and practice of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as emerging technology in structural biology. Cryo-EM methodologies covered include cryotomography, single particle reconstruction, electron crystallography, and microcrystal electron diffraction. Letter grading.
235. Rigor and Reproducibility
Units: 2.0
Lecture, one hour; discussion, one hour. Two cornerstones of science advancement are rigor in designing and performing scientific research and ability to reproduce biomedical research findings. Applications of rigor ensures robust and unbiased experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results. When results can be reproduced by multiple scientists, it validates original results and readiness to progress to next phase of research. Scientific rigor is strict application of scientific method to ensure unbiased and well-controlled experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results. Covers literature and videos on rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research. Discussion of issues raised by lecture, or case-studies, with training program faculty. Students learn that reproducibility is common problem in biomedical research and how to improve it. S/U grading.
252. Writing for Science
Units: 1.0
Seminar, one hour. Corequisite: Biological Chemistry 251A or 251B or 251C. Limited to first-year Molecular Biology PhD students. Development of specific skills in scientific writing within context of one advanced course on mechanics of gene transcription. Letter grading.
